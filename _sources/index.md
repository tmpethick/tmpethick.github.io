## Open source

- **[Scalable Gaussian Processes for Economic Models][master]**.
  This codebase can be used to run high-dimensional scalable Gaussian Processes on Economic Models on a High Performance Computing cluster.
- **[Ensembled Deep Network for Global Optimization][6]**.
  This project explores the behavior of an ensembled variant of the architecture proposed by [(Snoek et al 2015)][7] on various Bayesian Optimization benchmark problems.
- **[Prolog code generation from Isabelle's inner syntax][1]**. 
  This project compiles a theorem prover written and proven with Isabelle and compiles it into Prolog. It does so in Haskell through several catamorphism that changes the Isabelle AST into a Prolog AST.
- **[CampusNet Sync][2]**. A Dropbox like inspired app to sync your computer with the filesystem used at the Technical University of Denmark.
- **[Anki Onenote importer][3]**. 
  Allows one to import `.mht` files exported from OneNote into Anki.

... and more on [Github][4] including [this site][5] which was [originally][8] build by <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> with some added $\text{\LaTeX}$ goods. 
I have since moved to <a href="https://ebp.jupyterbook.org">the Executable Book Project</a> for a well-maintained codebase with many of the same features.
