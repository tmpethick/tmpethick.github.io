# About

I am currently doing a PhD at EPFL in the [LIONS lab][lions] with Prof. Volkan Cevher, where I am mostly focused on nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems.

I have written on a variety of areas outside of this blog prior to the PhD:

- My Master thesis on [Scalable Gaussian Processes for Economic Models][master].
- Bayesian Optimization using an [Ensembled Deep Network for Global Optimization][ensembled-dngo] which explores the behavior of an ensembled variant of the architecture proposed by [(Snoek et al 2015)][snoek2015] on various Bayesian Optimization benchmark problems.
- Environmental sound classification using [convolutional autoencoders][CAE] with an custom built unpooling layer in keras.
- [Bachelor][mcmc] on markov chain monte carlo and probabilistic programming.
- [Compilation][prover] of a theorem prover written in Isabelle into Prolog using catamorphism in Haskell.
- *A Process Calculus for Design and Modeling of Retro-synthesis* (published and presented at [EJC 2018 conference][ejc2018]).
- A [summary][DEL] of dynamic epistemic logic and game theory.


I have enjoyed being a teaching assistant in the following courses:

- [02405 Probability theory][02405]
- [02180 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence][02180]

<!-- Before I went into academia I worked on [card linked loyalty][birdback]
- app development in react
- [desktop development][campusnet] with electron -->
